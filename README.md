# simple-tab-js
This project is designed to introduce basic DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

Created a simple tab functionality using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. The page has four tabs, with the first tab being active by default. When the user clicks on another tab, the content of the current tab will be hidden, and the content of the selected tab will be displayed
